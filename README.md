Mathematica notebook files that are needed to generate all simulation results reported in the manuscript  "Positive feedback between demographic and selective fluctuations can greatly amplify the random fluctuation of population size" were uploaded:

HaplotypeSim.nb: This file contains all functions that are used in the two sets of simulations (codes in the two notebook files below) including those for reproduction, mutation, migration and recombination.
LongTermPolymorphism.nb: This file contains the code for simulating allele frequency changes over a given length of time so that long term balanced polymorphism can be investigated.
PositiveDirectional.nb: This file contains the code for simulating sequential fixation of 'A2' alleles under positive directional selection.
